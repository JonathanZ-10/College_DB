College Database **Work in Progress**
===================
This project combined three different programming languages and created the foundation for a possible College Database. During this project I created an API, a frontend, and a backend for the entire project and then deployed it using Docker and AWS. The frontend was programmed mostly in javascript utilizing Node JS, React, and Bootstrap. The backend was programmed using .Net Core in C# through VS Studio and lastly, the database was programmed using SQL Server through Microsoft SSMS.

## Specifications
Languages: Javascript / C# / SQL

IDE: VS Code and Visual Studio

Frameworks: React / Bootstrap / Node JS / .Net Core

Deployment: Docker / AWS

Project Length: 2 weeks

Programmer & Designer: Jonathan Zamora

## Features
- Three different tabs all working within one database
- Buttons to modify the database including add/delete/edit
- Ability to display, store, and delete profile photos
- Intricate and more complicated code accessed through AWS

## Todo
- Edit dockerfiles and finish uploading to AWS

## Known Issues
- N/A

## Experience
From this project I improved my Javascript, API, and cloud platform knowledge. I planned to create this project to get more experience using React, Bootstrap, and Node JS since my previous project was mostly HTML and CSS. This project was more challenging because it required much more backend coding than frontend, since I was focused mostly on being able to create a working database rather than a nice looking frontend. Regardless, I was able to create an API to handle SQL requests and linked it together through the frontend and was finally able to deploy the project using Docker and AWS.

The most challenging obstacle was learning to deploy each specific part of the project to a cloud platform since I had very little prior experience. This was made possible by dockerizing the project into different containers and ultimately being interconnected in AWS. Overall it was a great experience, being able to create an API through .Net Core and using C# was much more interesting that I anticipated. I would say this project has been my biggest learning experience so far.
