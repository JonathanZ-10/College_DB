College Database **Work in Progress**
===================
This project combined three different promgramming languages and created the foundation for a possible College Database. During this project I created an API, a frontend, and a backend for the entire project and then deployed it using Docker and AWS. The frontend was programmed mostly in javascript utilizing Node JS, React, and Bootstrap. The backend was programmed using .Net Core in C# through VS Studio and lastly, the database using SQL Server through Microsoft SSMS.

## Specifications
Languages: Javascript / C# / SQL

IDE: VS Code and Visual Studio

## Experience
From this project I improved my Javascript, API, and cloud platform knowledge. I planned to create this project to get more experience using React, Bootstrap, and Node JS since my previous project was mostly HTML and CSS. This project was more challenging because it required much more backend coding than frontend, since I was focused mostly on being able to create a working database rather than a nice looking frontend. Regardless, I was able to create an API to handle SQL requests and linked it together through the frontend and was finally able to deploy the project using Docker and AWS.

Overall it was a great experience being able to create an API through .Net Core and using C# which I enjoyed coding. I also really enjoyed coding in SQL and being able to deploy the project using a cloud platform.
